This work illustrates feedback via the balls travelling across the screen and being ”teleported” to a different place.
The input is initiated via a ball launched when the mouse is clicked.
The ball summons on a random position among the x-axis and travels down.
When it enters the black box, it is transported to a random position on the y-axis and begins travelling horizontally. 
The feedback loop occurs in the balls transportation. The input (mouse clicked) has an effect which launches the ball. 
The ball being launched is also an action which has an effect when it hits the black box, triggering the feedback and thereby creating
a new ball.
Once this new ball hits the black box again, it is all reset.  

I would describe this as a neutral loop.
Positive and negative loops increase or decrease in power/momentum/acceleration fx during their loop, but my work does not.
If the balls travelled faster and/or slower when they hit the black box, it may be described as either being positive or negative.
There is plenty of opportunity in this work to experiment with postive and negative feedback, but i wanted to keep the action streamlined
as it fit better with the overall ’feel’ of this world of transporting mini-balls. 

I chose to make this design based on my intial thoughts on a loop. I thought about a hypothetical portal which would constantly transport
objects in a loop and moving across different dimensions. I expanded upon this idea, added an input other elements and libraries. I also used for loop to create the grid.
