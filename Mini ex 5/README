The title of my work is ”Languageness of Academization”. I have used sentences found in various assigned texts for this year’s classes in both software studies and aesthetic programming. Whenever the mouse is pressed, it pulls random words from the found sentences and puts them toghether. The idea behind my work is based on an idea i contrived with Phillip while reading during the semester. We kinda  laughed and joked about some of the more crazy sentences and choice (and inventing) of words that some of the theorists and authors sometimes constructs. Of couse, most of these sentences are taken out of context and they do evidently make sense in the context of their originated texts, but we still found it funny to ’poke fun’ at some of the more ”academized” sentences. The idea behind this work was to make these complicated sentences even more complex but perhaps make the same amount of sense to the reader. Unfortunately i ran into a number of problems while using the Rita library which ultimately convoluted my work a bit. I originally intended to use the rita library to replace words in the sentences with random words from the Rita lexicon. 

The rita functions i’ve used are tokenize and untokenize. I originally intended the work to include more Rita functions, however the library worked very poorly with what i had intended, and brought much headache, as i literally copied the code from a Coding Train video into my editor, but it didn’t do the same on my computer. 
When i read the assignment for this mini ex i was really excited, as a really found the idea interesting. I still enjoyed making the project if it wasn’t for the rita library making zero sense to me (and everyone else). I would like to make another work using found text and typography without the limitation of having to use the rita library. 

Materiality in new media, that is the digital medias, express according to Bourchardon materiality in different ways. One of the ways is on the level of what happens in the machine, where the internal calculations constitute materiality. Perhaps more relevant, is materiality expressed through what happens in the interaction between the user and machine on a symbolic and behavioral level. How the machine responds from an user-action may spawn certain emotions with the user. Another way materiality is present within the new and digital medias is through the notion of manipulation. Being able to actively manipulate the text constitues a sense of materiality according to Bourchardon. This also leads him to say, that it is encouraged to look at the source codes to find additional information about the work. In my work i personally encourage you to look at the source text and see if you recognize some of the sentences and/or words we have read during the semester. Perhaps you could add more to the list? By just looking at Languageness of Academization it may seem totally confusing, but hopefully looking at the source code and knowing the origin of this text, changes your intial opinions on the work. Maybe you even agree to some extent and find the amusing/frustrating/interesting aspects of the language of our assigned texts, or as i have shamelessly dubbed them: ”Languageness of Academization”.
