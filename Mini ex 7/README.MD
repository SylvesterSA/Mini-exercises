This work is my attempt at making form art using DOM-elements. Genereally my work changed and progressed a lot throughout the process, but i always had a common idea: to recreate simple ’real-life’ shapes using the DOM-elements.
I realized early on that is was necessary for me to focus on simple shapes within the context of form art, because of the complexity of doing (seemingly) simple tasks with the DOM elements. Another reason i focused on the technical aspect of object oriented programming as opposed to the ’art’ of the competition is the nature of the overall competition.
The competition was created back in the late 90’s where using seemingly only functional objects in a creative, new and artful way was a new, and in some ways, groundbreaking thing. However i got the impression, that a similar art competition would gather a lot less traction. The creater of the competition, Alexei Shulgin, even agrees, stating in his interview that it wouldn’t be possible do to the high number of custom shapes making the distinctive shapes of his time none-relevant and that his notions and ideas of web aesthetics are being used by corporates and politics. 

Some of the advantages of using object oriented programming is the ability to reuse your ”formulas” in other similar instances. It clusters objects under ’classes’ where the have certain properties and functions. If you can understand what the individual elements do, i creates a nice overview for your objects in your code.
Some of the limitations (and mostly frustrations) i encountered while using objects (in this case especially DOM elements) is the apparent differnce between using regular objects (rect, ellipse etc.) compared to DOM (sliders, checkbox etc). The same code but with different elements did not work, and annoying workarounds were needed to achieve the same outcome.
