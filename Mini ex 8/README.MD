For this mini exercise i have chosen the phyllotaxis coding challenge. The shapes resembles that of certain plants in nature. I used it because of itâ€™s patterns and simplicity. I have added functions to the left and right arrow, which changes the degree and colours accordingly.  I strongly encourage the user to wait a bit after having pressed either the left og right to see a result. Continous pressing mainly creates a random mess seemingly without shape. Best, wait for the animation to emerge without pressing any button, and then press once, and see the effects. This is also illustrated in the flowchart. 
The difficulty if this exercise varies depending on chosen challenge and the amount of syntax added. My focus was mainly on the flowchart, and i chose it, because of the nice flowchart result i could create from the work. Flowcharts are very helpful at seeing the flow and progression of a system. By immediatly diving into a system or program it may be confusing and non-sensical at first. A flowchart illustrates the different possibilities and outcomes of a system.
