Describe your coding process

My coding process consisted mainly of trial and error. 
I had a couple of ideas on what i wanted to make and tried my best via the things i had previously learned, p5.jsâ€™ reference page and via discussion with my fellow classmates. 
I contiounsly added more and more elements to my code in ways i found interesting and amusing for my project. 

What constitues a program? 

A program is certain set of orders for a computer to operate.
As a programmer you decide and construct the orders for the computer to operate, thereby making your program the result of your work with programming languages on the computer. 

Reflect on the notion of error. 

An error is when a result is different than the intended result. It can result in the program not running at all.
Glitches are the result of visual errors, where the program may run, but not with the intended visuals represented. 
However it is also possible to purposely make glitches in a program, as a form of aesthetic and/or artistic expression. 
Error can be thought of not only as something to fear, but instead as a means to bring the capacity of something new.  Errors allows for the potential of new, unforseen and creative artistic expression. 
The artistic expression can be seen as happening between the error and the user (and thereby not the programmer). 
These errors can be utilized in our traditional computer programs to allow the possibility for new meanings to emerge. It is also theorized that the machine-user relationship ties the user to the actual errors and glitches, thereby making the user susceptible to glitches aswell.
