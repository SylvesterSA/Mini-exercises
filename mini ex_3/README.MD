This throbber consists of two throbbers, a spinning ball in the middle and 4 balls bouncing from the edges towards the center. 
Upon initial start of the program, a textbox with a question pops up, asking the user how long they can wait. 
This was a fun little play on the waiting time associated with throbbers. I intended the spinning throbber to continously to change colours within the given spectru, 
but it didnt work as expected. 


How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?
Programming opens up a whole new world of visual art, culture and so forth. The many cultures represented online in different communities
all stem from a programming background, therefore also uniting the different cultures with a common thing. This also allows for continious
change in these cultures via the change in the code.
